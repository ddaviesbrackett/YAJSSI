bugs:

stop() isn't good enough for stopping moving, because it murders fades as well (so moving while dying sucks)
  --either that, or no moving while dying, which makes sense...

investigate dequeue() as a mechanism for unpausing animations rather than doing the crazy bPause thing
	--doesn't work!  I mean, it works fine for inserting delays, but doesn't for arbitrary pausing (unless I feel like reimplementing .animate()).
